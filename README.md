# Welcome to the Tide of Tomorrow 🌊
### where the endless horizons of the ocean meet the limitless potential of the future

**`Digital Nomad && Time Traveller`**

I'm a tech enthusiast who loves diving into code and solving complex problems. From building sleek web apps to crafting efficient algorithms, I enjoy the thrill of turning ideas into reality and beyond. My only enemies are lack of sleep and creativity congestions. There was that fingernail-biting monster story about — how were they called again? — Ahhh yes... bugs. Stay ready!

> Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster.

## 💡 Fun Fact
I once hiked a 6962m peak just to catch the sunrise. It was worth every step and my heart rate is almost back at normal, but still no breath left!
